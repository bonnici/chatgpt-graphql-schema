# ChatGPT GraphQL Schema

To run: `npm start -- https://countries.trevorblades.com/`, but it must be an unauthenticated and relatively small public API.

An OpenAI API key must be passed in using an env variable which can be done by making a `.env` file with this structure:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="key-here"
```

### Using https://barcelona-urban-mobility-graphql-api.netlify.app/graphql to ask about public transport in Barcelona

````
2262 tokens in schema, each question will cost about 0.90 cents

User input:
> where is the "Encants" metro station and what lines run on it?

GraphQL query from ChatGPT:
Here's the GraphQL query you can use to get the information you're looking for:

```graphql
{
  metroStation(findBy: {name: "Encants"}) {
    ... on MetroStation {
      name
      coordinates {
        latitude
        longitude
      }
      lines
    }
  }
}
```

This will return the name, coordinates, and lines of the "Encants" metro station in Barcelona.

Response from GraphQL endpoint:
{"data":{"metroStation":{"name":"Encants","coordinates":{"latitude":41.407236,"longitude":2.1827},"lines":["L2"]}}}

ChatGPT's interpretation of response:
The response includes the location information for the metro station with the name "Encants", including its name, latitude, longitude, and which metro lines it belongs to. The station is located at latitude 41.407236 and longitude 2.1827, and belongs to the L2 metro line.

User input:
> what other stations are on that line?

GraphQL query from ChatGPT:
Here's the GraphQL query you can use to get the information you're looking for:

```graphql
{
  metroLine(findBy: {id: 2}) {
    ... on MetroLine {
      name
      stations {
        edges {
          node {
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This will return the name of the line (in this case, L2) and the names of all the stations on that line. You can see if Encants is on that list.

I should note that the `id: 2` parameter in the `findBy` argument specifies that we're looking for the line with the ID of 2. Since we know that Encants is on the L2 line, we can use this value to find the line and its associated stations.

Response from GraphQL endpoint:
{"data":{"metroLine":{"name":"L2","stations":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Badalona Pompeu Fabra"}},{"node":{"name":"Passeig de GrÃ cia"}},{"node":{"name":"Encants"}},{"node":{"name":"Sant Roc"}},{"node":{"name":"Pep Ventura"}},{"node":{"name":"Sant Antoni"}},{"node":{"name":"Universitat"}},{"node":{"name":"Bac de Roda"}},{"node":{"name":"Artigues | Sant AdriÃ "}},{"node":{"name":"Verneda"}},{"node":{"name":"ParalÂ·lel"}},{"node":{"name":"La Pau"}},{"node":{"name":"Tetuan"}},{"node":{"name":"Monumental"}},{"node":{"name":"Clot"}},{"node":{"name":"Sant MartÃ­"}},{"node":{"name":"Gorg"}},{"node":{"name":"Sagrada FamÃ­lia"}}]}}}}

ChatGPT's interpretation of response:
The response includes the information for metro line with the id of 2, including its name and the stations that are part of this metro line. The metro line is L2 and it has several stations, including Badalona Pompeu Fabra, Passeig de GrÃ cia, Encants, Sant Roc, Pep Ventura, and other stations as can be seen in the response.

User input:
> find the closest bike station to Encant's location

GraphQL query from ChatGPT:
Here's the GraphQL query you can use to find the closest bike station to Encants' location:

```graphql
{
  metroStation(findBy: {name: "Encants"}) {
    ... on MetroStation {
      name
      coordinates {
        latitude
        longitude
      }
      closestBikeStation: bikeStations(first: 1, filterBy: {only: {isInService: true}}) {
        edges {
          node {
            name
            coordinates {
              latitude
              longitude
            }
            distanceFromEncants: distanceTo(
              coordinates: {
                latitude: 41.407236,
                longitude: 2.1827
              }
            )
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This query will return the name and coordinates of the closest bike station that is currently in service to the Encants metro station, as well as the distance between them in meters (the `distanceFromEncants` field).

Please note that the `closestBikeStation` field in the query uses an alias to assign a different name to the returned field. This is to avoid confusion with the `bikeStation` query, which is used to find information about a specific bike station.

Response from GraphQL endpoint:
{"errors":[{"message":"Cannot query field \"bikeStations\" on type \"MetroStation\".","extensions":{}}]}

User input:
> that query doesn't work on the schema I provided. You need to use the bikeStation query from that schema and pass the location into the findBy field

GraphQL query from ChatGPT:
You're absolutely right, I apologize for my mistake. Here's the corrected query using the `bikeStation` query:

```graphql
{
  bikeStation(findBy: {closest: {latitude: 41.407236, longitude: 2.1827}}) {
    ... on BikeStation {
      name
      coordinates {
        latitude
        longitude
      }
      status
    }
  }
}
```

This should return the name, coordinates, and status of the closest bike station to the location of Encants, as determined by its latitude and longitude coordinates. In this case, since we're looking for the closest station, we're using the `FindByInput` argument's `closest` field to filter for the bike station closest to the given coordinates.

Response from GraphQL endpoint:
{"data":{"bikeStation":{"name":"C/ DOS DE MAIG, 230-232","coordinates":{"latitude":41.4071692,"longitude":2.1820722},"status":"IN_SERVICE"}}}

ChatGPT's interpretation of response:
The response includes the information for the bike station that is closest to the coordinates provided (latitude 41.407236 and longitude 2.1827), including its name, latitude, longitude, and status. The name of the closest bike station is "C/ DOS DE MAIG, 230-232", it has a latitude of 41.4071692 and a longitude of 2.1820722, and it is currently in service.

### Using https://fruits-api.netlify.app/graphql to find and delete fruits

````
472 tokens in schema, each question will cost about 0.19 cents

User input:
> what's the id and name of all the available fruit?

GraphQL query from ChatGPT:
To get the ID and name of all available fruit, you can use this GraphQL query:

```
query {
  fruits {
    id
    fruit_name
  }
}
```

Response from GraphQL endpoint:
{"data":{"fruits":[{"id":"1","fruit_name":"Manzana"},{"id":"3","fruit_name":"Banana"},{"id":"4","fruit_name":"LimÃ³n"},{"id":"5","fruit_name":"Mandarina"},{"id":"6","fruit_name":"Naranja"},{"id":"7","fruit_name":"Pomelo"},{"id":"8","fruit_name":"Damasco"},{"id":"9","fruit_name":"Ciruela"},{"id":"10","fruit_name":"Durazno"},{"id":"11","fruit_name":"NÃ­spero"},{"id":"12","fruit_name":"Pitahaya"},{"id":"13","fruit_name":"Tamarindo"},{"id":"14","fruit_name":"Mango"},{"id":"15","fruit_name":"GuanÃ¡bana"},{"id":"16","fruit_name":"Cereza"},{"id":"17","fruit_name":"Guayabas"},{"id":"18","fruit_name":"Aguacate (o palta)"},{"id":"19","fruit_name":"Coco"},{"id":"20","fruit_name":"Carambola"},{"id":"21","fruit_name":"Higo"},{"id":"22","fruit_name":"Granada"},{"id":"23","fruit_name":"Aceituna"},{"id":"24","fruit_name":"Lichi"},{"id":"25","fruit_name":"DuriÃ¡n"},{"id":"26","fruit_name":"Yaca"},{"id":"27","fruit_name":"Mangostino"},{"id":"28","fruit_name":"pomegranate"},{"id":"29","fruit_name":"pineapple"},{"id":"30","fruit_name":"Persimmon Fruit"},{"id":"31","fruit_name":"kiwi"},{"id":"32","fruit_name":"cereza de monte o capulÃ­n"},{"id":"33","fruit_name":"limetta dulce, limÃ³n dulce, lima dulce y/o simplemente lima"},{"id":"34","fruit_name":"cuajiniquil, cuijinicuil, cuinicuil o vaina"},{"id":"35","fruit_name":"Almendra"},{"id":"36","fruit_name":"Nuez"},{"id":"37","fruit_name":"Avellana"},{"id":"38","fruit_name":"Tejocote"}]}}

ChatGPT's interpretation of response:
The JSON response is returning an array of objects where each object represents a fruit, containing two fields: `id` and `fruit_name`. The `id` field is a unique identifier for each fruit and the `fruit_name` field is the name of the fruit. The array contains information for all of the fruits in the database, sorted in ascending order by `id`.

User input:
> delete Banana

GraphQL query from ChatGPT:
To delete a fruit, in this case, Banana, you can use the following mutation query:

```
mutation {
  deleteFruit(id: 3) {
    id
    fruit_name
  }
}
```

This will delete the fruit with `id` equal to 3 and will return the `id` and `fruit_name` of the deleted fruit.

Response from GraphQL endpoint:
{"data":{"deleteFruit":{"id":null,"fruit_name":null}}}

ChatGPT's interpretation of response:
The JSON response is returning an object with the `id` and `fruit_name` fields set to `null`. This is because the `deleteFruit` mutation was executed with the argument `id` set to `3`, so the server attempted to delete the fruit with `id` of 3 from the database. If the deletion was successful, the server should have returned an object containing the values of the `id` and `fruit_name` fields for the deleted fruit. However, in this case, the deletion was not successful and the server returned an object with both fields set to `null`. It's possible that the fruit with `id` of 3 does not exist in the database or there was an error during the deletion process.

User input:
> what are the ids of the remaining fruit?

GraphQL query from ChatGPT:
To get the ids of the remaining fruit after deleting Banana, you can use this GraphQL query:

```
query {
  fruits {
    id
  }
}
```

This will return the `id` of all the remaining fruit in the database.

Response from GraphQL endpoint:
{"data":{"fruits":[{"id":"1"},{"id":"4"},{"id":"5"},{"id":"6"},{"id":"7"},{"id":"8"},{"id":"9"},{"id":"10"},{"id":"11"},{"id":"12"},{"id":"13"},{"id":"14"},{"id":"15"},{"id":"16"},{"id":"17"},{"id":"18"},{"id":"19"},{"id":"20"},{"id":"21"},{"id":"22"},{"id":"23"},{"id":"24"},{"id":"25"},{"id":"26"},{"id":"27"},{"id":"28"},{"id":"29"},{"id":"30"},{"id":"31"},{"id":"32"},{"id":"33"},{"id":"34"},{"id":"35"},{"id":"36"},{"id":"37"},{"id":"38"}]}}

ChatGPT's interpretation of response:
The JSON response is returning an array of objects where each object represents a fruit, containing the `id` field only. The `id` field is a unique identifier for each fruit contained in the `fruits` array. This query is requesting the ID for all the fruits in the database, so the server returns an array of all the fruits' `id` values sorted in ascending order.

The `results` field contains an array of character objects, where each object has a `name` and an `id` field. The response contains the name and id of the first 20 characters on the first page of the list.

User input:
> what episodes was Albert Einstein in?

GraphQL query from ChatGPT:
Unfortunately, according to the schema provided, there is no information on whether any characters are based on real-life people, so Albert Einstein is not actually a character in the show. If you were looking for another character, please let me know!

User input:
> that's not correct, he was present in the response of my first query

GraphQL query from ChatGPT:
I apologize for the confusion, I misunderstood your initial question. Here's a GraphQL query that will return the episodes in which Albert Einstein appears:

```graphql
query {
  character(id: 11) {
    name
    episode {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

This query uses the `character` query with an argument of `id: 11` to retrieve information about the character with ID 11, which is Albert Einstein. It then returns the character's name and the `episode` field, which is an array of episodes in which the character appears. Each episode contains a `name` field, which is returned in the response.

Response from GraphQL endpoint:
{"data":{"character":{"name":"Albert Einstein","episode":[{"name":"A Rickle in Time"}]}}}

ChatGPT's interpretation of response:
The JSON response contains information about the character with an `id` of 11, which is Albert Einstein. The `name` field of the character object contains their name. The `episode` field is an array of episodes in which the character appears. The array contains an object with a `name` field for the only episode in which Albert Einstein appears, which is "A Rickle in Time".
