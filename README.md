# ChatGPT GraphQL Schema

A fairly hacky experiment that allows plain English interaction with public GraphQL endpoints using ChatGPT.

To run: `npm start -- https://countries.trevorblades.com/`, but it must be an unauthenticated and relatively small public API.

An OpenAI API key must be passed in using an env variable which can be done by making a `.env` file with this structure:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="key-here"
```

## Working endpoints
* `https://countries.trevorblades.com/` - basic country data
* `https://space-courses-api.herokuapp.com/` - fake Odyssey courses
* `https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql` - rick and morty
* `https://comet-cruises-api.herokuapp.com/` - tiny example locations service
* `https://comet-cruises-activities.herokuapp.com/` - tiny example activities service
* `https://api.react-finland.fi/graphql` - data about react conferences in finland
* `https://barcelona-urban-mobility-graphql-api.netlify.app/graphql` - data about bike/metro/bus stations in barcelona
* `https://fruits-api.netlify.app/graphql` - fruit info

## Non-working endpoints
* `https://graphql.anilist.co/` - too many tokens (43562)
* `https://api.github.com/graphql` - needs authentication and almost definitely too big
* `https://beta.pokeapi.co/graphql/v1beta` - too many characters (5640630)
* `https://api.apollographql.com/graphql` - no introspection?
* `http://api.catalysis-hub.org/graphql` - too many tokens (78686)
* `https://api.digitransit.fi/routing/v1/routers/finland/index/graphql` - Too many characters in schema (150607)
* `https://api.ean-search.org/graphql` - needs auth
* `https://api.stratz.com/graphql` - needs auth?
* `https://tmdb.apps.quintero.io/` - Too many characters in schema (155243) (5874 tokens)
* `https://linkedsdg.officialstatistics.org/graphql` - Too many characters in schema (194040)

User input:
> what currency do they use in australia?

GraphQL query from ChatGPT:
```
{
  country(code: "AU") {
    currency
  }
}
```

Response from GraphQL endpoint:

User input:
> what other countries use that currency?

GraphQL query from ChatGPT:
```
{
  countries(filter: { currency: { eq: "AUD" } }) {
    name
  }
}
```

Response from GraphQL endpoint:
{"data":{"countries":[{"name":"Australia"},{"name":"Cocos [Keeling] Islands"},{"name":"Christmas Island"},{"name":"Heard Island and McDonald Islands"},{"name":"Kiribati"},{"name":"Norfolk Island"},{"name":"Nauru"},{"name":"Tuvalu"}]}}

ChatGPT's interpretation of response:
These are the countries that use the "AUD" currency: Australia, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island, Heard Island and McDonald Islands, Kiribati, Norfolk Island, Nauru, and Tuvalu. The response includes an array of objects, each representing a country that uses AUD, and each object has a "name" field that gives the name of the country.

User input:
> what's the ID of Kiribati?

GraphQL query from ChatGPT:
```
{
  country(code: "KI") {
    code
  }
}
```

Response from GraphQL endpoint:
{"data":{"country":{"code":"KI"}}}

ChatGPT's interpretation of response:
The ID of Kiribati is "KI".

    }
    states {
      name
    }

{"data":{"country":{"name":"Kiribati","capital":"South Tarawa","code":"KI","emoji":"ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡®","currencies":["AUD"],"continent":{"name":"Oceania"},"states":[],"languages":[{"name":"English"}]}}}

ChatGPT's interpretation of response:
This is all the information available for Kiribati, as returned by the API:

- "name": the name of the country ("Kiribati").
- "capital": the capital of the country ("South Tarawa").
- "code": the unique code of the country ("KI").
- "emoji": the flag emoji for the country ("ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡®").
- "currencies": an array of the currencies used in the country (in this case, just "AUD").
- "continent": an object that represents the continent the country is in, which has a "name" field that gives the name of the continent ("Oceania").
- "states": an array of the country's sub-national divisions; in this case, it's empty because Kiribati doesn't have any states or provinces.
- "languages": an array of the official languages spoken in the country (in this case, just "English").

The response indicates that the mutation was successful. The `code` is an HTTP-status code of 200, and the `message` is a human-readable message. The `success` field is set to `true`, confirming a successful mutation. The `track` field contains information about the track whose views where incremented. Its `id` is "c_8", and its `title` is "Cat-strodynamics 101". Finally, the new `numberOfViews` field is set to 1, indicating that the number of views for that track has been incremented by 1.
